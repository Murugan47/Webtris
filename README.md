# WebTris

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently a WIP! 
> ⚠️ **WebGL Limitations:** The WebGL demo may have missing sounds or other features due to WebGL build constraints. For full functionality, open the project in Unity.

This is a Unity project for a **Tetris-style block game**. The framework allows you to spawn tetromino pieces, move and rotate them, and place them on a board. It’s fully customizable, making it easy to experiment with Tetris mechanics in Unity.  

**Basic functionality exists**, but **SRS Rotation, Piece Hold, and other advanced systems are currently WIP**.
